This is our android mobile application for group 15. 

The primary idea of this project is to have a platform that enables second-hand shops to display their products more vividly to their customers. Also, enables the customers to search their desired products through our application and reserve them before picking them up at the store site within three-day time limit. 

The designs were made in Figma. We based the project on jetpack compose and the coding language is Kotlin. 
Firebase authentication, Firebase firestore database and Firebase storage were used for storing user and item data and displaying images. 

User can signup and login using username and password. Below is the examples of users:
